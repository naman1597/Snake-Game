A snake game is a simple game where a snake moves around a box trying to eat an Food. Once it successfully eats the Food, the length of the snake increases and score will increases.
Then the game is over when the snake runs into itself or any of the four walls of the box.
Once game was over high-score was updated if score is greater than previous high-score.
